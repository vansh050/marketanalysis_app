# Phase 3 — Per-Broker Legacy → SDK Audit

> **Source of truth for whether a broker can move from legacy modal → SDK widget.** The `SDK_ELIGIBLE_MODALS` allowlist in `ModalManager.js` MUST be derived from this doc, not the other way around. See `CLAUDE.md § Phase 3 SDK Broker Migration — BLOCKING DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENT`.

## Zerodha runtime hardening — 2026-09-22

The current AlphaB2B release configuration enables the SDK broker flow and the
dispatcher fallback set contains only IIFL, so Zerodha reaches
`Phase3SdkBrokerModal` → SDK `WebViewBrokerAuthFlow`. Following a report that
the app closed from the Zerodha login page, the RN SDK now remounts a WebView
whose Android renderer or Apple content process terminates. A second
termination exits through the normal retryable error surface with code
`broker_webview_process_gone`.

This closes the unhandled dead-renderer lifecycle gap. It does not change URL
minting, callback matching, token exchange, cookies, or the broker verdict.
Device verification of the exact reported handset remains pending because no
crash stack was supplied; source test `zerodhaWebViewSession.spec.ts` pins the
recovery handlers, keyed remount, and terminal error code.

## Verdict definitions

- **SDK-clean** — every legacy UX surface is mapped to a working SDK equivalent. Safe to add to `SDK_ELIGIBLE_MODALS`. End-to-end verified on emulator.
- **SDK-with-gap** — known gaps between legacy and SDK. Stays out of allowlist until gaps close. Each gap is a row in this doc with a fix plan.
- **SDK-broken** — SDK path is fundamentally incomplete or regressed; no near-term plan. Stays legacy.
- **Not-audited** — row exists but the audit hasn't been done. Treat as SDK-broken until audited.
- **Incomplete-audit** — partial audit (e.g. only the wrapper file was read; deeper component requires follow-up).

## Audit row schema

For each broker, the row captures:

- **Legacy modal file** — path under `src/components/BrokerConnectionModal/` (or `src/components/`).
- **Legacy submit endpoint(s)** — backend route(s) the modal posts to, with file:line references.
- **Encryption envelope** — what the legacy modal encrypts before wire transmission.
- **Form fields collected** — what the user enters.
- **OAuth WebView flow** — whether OAuth is used; how the redirect is intercepted.
- **Reauth handling** — whether `reauthConfig` is consumed and what shape it takes.
- **IP-whitelist callout** — whether EgressIpCallout (or equivalent) gates submit.
- **Broker-specific quirks** — anything outside the standard credentials/OAuth shape.
- **Success / error handling** — what the modal does on 2xx / 4xx / network error.
- **Gap vs SDK widget** — concrete gap between legacy and SDK pair (`BrokerCredentialForm` + `WebViewBrokerAuthFlow`).
- **Verdict** — SDK-clean / SDK-with-gap / SDK-broken / Not-audited / Incomplete-audit.
- **Last verified** — date + commit SHA + emulator/device evidence.

## Summary table

| Broker | visibleModal key | SDK BrokerName | Legacy modal | Verdict (today) |
|--------|------------------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Zerodha | `Zerodha` | `Zerodha` | `ZerodhaConnectModal.js` (thin wrapper around `ZerodhaConnectUI`) | **Incomplete-audit** — Android intercept logic in UI component not yet read. Treat as SDK-broken. (User-reported Play Store hang 2026-05-26 — under live emulator investigation; see § Zerodha for live hypotheses.) |
| Angel One | `Angel One` | `Angel One` | `Phase3SdkBrokerModal` (per-customer) | **SDK — per-customer only (2026-07-18; completed 2026-09-29).** Dispatcher always selects `Phase3SdkBrokerModal` (customer `apiKey`/`secretKey`/`clientCode` + static-IP gate), with SDK flag on or off. With `deviceTotpEnabled`, `DeviceTotpReconnectGate` wraps that SDK modal for biometric quick reconnect. The shared-SmartAPI `AngleoneBookingModal` is no longer reachable from the dispatcher (the device-TOTP fallback path to it was removed 2026-09-29). Guard: `src/__tests__/brokerDispatchRouting.test.js`. Earlier verdict (SDK-broken / `SDK_LEGACY_FALLBACK`, 2026-04-30) is historical. |
| Upstox | `Upstox` | `Upstox` | `upstoxModal.js` | **SDK-clean** (PROMOTED 2026-04-28) — IP_WHITELIST_BROKERS + backend /exchange-token dispatch + SDK_ELIGIBLE_MODALS. Reauth still routes to legacy via `isReauthFlow` short-circuit. |
| ICICI Direct | `ICICI` | `ICICI Direct` | `icicimodal.js` | **SDK-clean** (PROMOTED 2026-04-28) — backend `/exchange-token` ICICI dispatch already existed (connections.js:1180-1205, exchanges `apisession`→`session_token`); IP_WHITELIST_BROKERS already included; just needed allowlist promotion. |
| Kotak Securities | `Kotak` | `Kotak` | `KotakModal.js` | **SDK-clean** (PROMOTED 2026-04-28, with documented minor diff) — credentials_totp; backend `/update-credentials` dispatches to `/api/kotak/connect-broker`. Minor diff: 30s TOTP debounce + TOTP error parsing not in SDK widget. |
| Dhan | `Dhan` | `Dhan` | `DhanConnectModal.js` | **SDK-clean** (PROMOTED 2026-04-28) — partner-OAuth, no IP gate needed, backend `/exchange-token` fallthrough handles `dhan_client_id` + `dhan_access_token`. Just needed allowlist promotion. Minor diff: prefetch optimization + manual fallback path not in SDK widget. |
| Fyers | `Fyers` | `Fyers` | `FyersConnect.js` | **SDK-clean** (PROMOTED 2026-04-28) — IP_WHITELIST extension + backend `/exchange-token` Fyers dispatch (translates field-naming inversion server-side: modal `apiKey` → ccxt `clientSecret`, modal `secretKey` → ccxt `clientId`). Reauth routes to legacy. |
| IIFL Securities | `IIFL` / `IIFL Securities` | `IIFL Securities` | `src/components/iiflmodal.js` | **SDK-broken / legacy-correct** (direct flow enabled 2026-09-27) — SDK schema still describes a different credentials/TOTP product. The deliberate fallback now collects the customer's App Key/App Secret, gates on the displayed Route64 IPv6, uses Node login-url/exchange routes, and persists the session in MongoDB. |
| AliceBlue | `AliceBlue` | `AliceBlue` | `AliceBlueConnect.js` | **SDK-clean** (PROMOTED 2026-04-28) — schema changed to `flow=oauth, fields=[]`; backend `/login-url` hardcodes `origin=https://prod.alphaquark.in`; backend `/exchange-token` accepts `{access_token, client_id}`. |
| Motilal Oswal | `Motilal` | `Motilal Oswal` | `MotilalModal.js` | **SDK-clean** (PROMOTED 2026-04-28, with documented minor diff) — IP_WHITELIST + backend `/exchange-token` Motilal dispatch + SDK_ELIGIBLE. Minor diff: SDK widget lacks 30s session-affinity debounce (user-accepted minor diff). |
| HDFC Securities | `HDFC` | `Hdfc Securities` | `HDFCconnectModal.js` | **SDK-clean** (PROMOTED 2026-04-28) — added to `IP_WHITELIST_BROKERS` + backend `/exchange-token` HDFC dispatch + `BrokerConnectModalDispatch.SDK_ELIGIBLE_MODALS` |
| Groww | `Groww` | `Groww` | `GrowwConnectModal.js` | **SDK-clean** (PROMOTED 2026-04-29) — SDK schema reshaped to 2 fields (apiKey JWT + growwTotpSeed Base32, permissive `^[A-Z2-7]+$/i`); backend `/sdk/v1/connections/Groww/connect` dispatches to `/api/groww/update-key` via `CREDENTIAL_BROKER_VALIDATE_DISPATCH`, full ccxt validation runs server-side. |
| Axis Securities | `Axis Securities` | `Axis Securities` | `AxisConnectModal.js` | **SDK-clean** (PROMOTED 2026-04-28) — backend dispatches verified present (connections.js:894 `/login-url`, 1117 `/exchange-token`); removed from SDK_LEGACY_FALLBACK + added to SDK_ELIGIBLE_MODALS. Subject to upstream Axis SSO bug 1083 (Axis-side, not ours). |

**Today's intended `SDK_ELIGIBLE_MODALS` membership** (post 2026-04-29 Groww promotion):
```
{HDFC, Upstox, ICICI, Motilal, Dhan, Kotak, AliceBlue, Fyers, Axis Securities, Groww, DummyBroker}
```
IIFL remains a documented legacy fallback because of the SDK schema mismatch;
its fallback is now production-capable and enabled. Treat the promotion counts
in older entries below as historical snapshots rather than current routing.

## Per-broker rows

### Zerodha — Incomplete-audit (treat as SDK-broken)

- **Legacy modal file:** `src/components/BrokerConnectionModal/ZerodhaConnectModal.js` — thin wrapper that delegates to `ZerodhaConnectUI` (the actual implementation). Wrapper handles `handleConnectionSuccess` (refresh broker status, emit refreshEvent, close modal).
- **Audit status:** Wrapper-only audit completed. The 500+-line `ZerodhaConnectUI` component (Android intercept logic, apiKey-from-env seeding, Kite Publisher SDK fallback) needs a separate read pass.
- **Known facts (from prior context, NOT yet re-verified):**
  - apiKey is read from `Config.REACT_APP_ZERODHA_API_KEY` at modal open time, not collected.
  - Android-aware redirect intercept — custom `onShouldStartLoadWithRequest` + URL-pattern fallback to catch `kite.zerodha.com` → `prod.alphaquark.in/stock-recommendation?request_token=…` even when Android resolves the 302 chain internally.
  - `prod.alphaquark.in/stock-recommendation` 302's unauthenticated visitors to `/login`. Android resolves the 302 internally before JS hooks fire — the SDK widget misses the original `request_token`-bearing URL.
  - **Real fix is out-of-band**: register a non-redirecting redirect URL on Kite developer portal (e.g. `app-links.alphaquark.in/zerodha-callback`).
- **Verdict:** **Incomplete-audit** — treat as SDK-broken. Until ZerodhaConnectUI is read AND the Kite dev-portal redirect is migrated, Zerodha stays legacy. In `SDK_LEGACY_FALLBACK` today.
- **Last verified:** 2026-04-28, commit `4aca2d4`. Wrapper-level audit only.

### Zerodha — 2026-05-26 live investigation (does NOT update verdict — see § PHASE3_PROGRESS 2026-05-26)

User-reported on Play Store APK: SDK Zerodha "keeps loading and does not go forward." Static read this session (`ZerodhaConnectUI.js` end-to-end, `Phase3SdkBrokerModal.js`, SDK `WebViewBrokerAuthFlow.tsx`, backend `connections.js` Zerodha branches) found NO obvious bug in routing. Specifically: `extras.apiKey` is correctly seeded from `REACT_APP_ZERODHA_API_KEY`; SDK `WebViewBrokerAuthFlow` has four belt-and-suspenders intercept paths (injectedJavaScript + onShouldStartLoadWithRequest + onLoadStart + onNavigationStateChange); `request_token` is in `_kOauthCallbackParamNames`; backend `/login-url` and `/exchange-token` both dispatch to the right ccxt endpoints. Also confirmed: the prior audit claim that legacy `ZerodhaConnectUI` has "custom `onShouldStartLoadWithRequest` + URL-pattern fallback" is aspirational — legacy uses ONLY `onNavigationStateChange` (line 410-426), so the SDK already has MORE intercept coverage than legacy. There is no "Android logic to port."

Three live hang-cause hypotheses, ranked:
1. **Backend `userEmail` resolution failure (MOST LIKELY)**: `connections.js:1601` passes `userEmail` from `req.sdkSession` to ccxt `/zerodha/gen-access-token`. Firebase phone-only signin = null `user_email` = ccxt can't resolve platform `apiSecret` = 502 after 20s timeout → looks like "stuck loading" to a user who doesn't wait the full 20s.
2. **Android 302 race**: `prod.alphaquark.in/stock-recommendation?request_token=…` 302s to `/login` when AQ session cookie is absent. Android may resolve the chain server-side before the SDK's `onLoadStart` fires on the intermediate URL — `WebViewBrokerAuthFlow.tsx:533` acknowledges this on some Android WebView builds.
3. **ccxt `/zerodha/login-url` upstream timeout** (15s, `connections.js:1198`) — least likely.

Live investigation in progress on emulator + adb logcat to pin the hang phase before code changes. Verdict will be updated post-reproduction.

### Angel One — SDK-broken

- **Legacy modal file:** `src/components/BrokerConnectionModal/AngleoneBookingModal.js`
- **Submit endpoint(s):**
  - WebView navigates to `https://smartapi.angelbroking.com/publisher-login?api_key=${REACT_APP_ANGEL_ONE_API_KEY}` (hardcoded broker URL, line 34).
  - `PUT ${server.server.baseUrl}api/user/connect-broker` (line 110) — persists jwtToken + apiKey + ddpi_status.
- **Encryption envelope:** None — publisher OAuth `auth_token` passed plaintext.
- **Form fields collected:** **None.** Pure publisher-OAuth flow.
- **OAuth WebView flow:** Yes. WebView loads Angel One publisher-login URL with embedded `api_key`. Intercepts via `onNavigationStateChange` (line 82), detects `auth_token=` (line 84), extracts and closes (line 89).
- **Reauth handling:** No `reauthConfig` prop.
- **IP-whitelist callout:** None.
- **Broker-specific quirks:**
  - **Partner-OAuth (broker-initiated)** — Angel One owns the flow; the apiKey is embedded in the WebView URL as a query param, not user-supplied.
  - `ddpi_status` field is persisted alongside `jwtToken` for compliance tracking.
  - Per-customer SmartAPI flow (web-only today, per `prod-alphaquark-github` 0202f27c): user supplies their own `apiKey + secretKey + clientCode` to mint a personal publisher-login URL via `/api/angel-one/update-key` BEFORE OAuth. Mobile-side per-customer mode is on the backlog.
- **Success handling:** Close WebView → PUT connect-broker → toast + refreshEvent.
- **Error handling:** "Connection Error" / "Connection Issue" wording (lines 189–204).
- **Gap vs SDK widget:**
  1. SDK schema today: `flow=oauth, fields=[apiKey, secretKey, clientCode]`. Legacy: NO form, broker-initiated OAuth with embedded shared apiKey. The two are fundamentally different.
  2. SDK widget doesn't support `flow=publisher-oauth` (broker-initiated, no user form, embedded apiKey).
  3. Backend `/sdk/v1/connections/Angel One/exchange-token` doesn't yet handle Angel One callback (auth_token → ccxt `/angelone/generate-session` → mint long-lived JWT).
  4. Per-customer mode requires `flow=credentials-then-oauth` (collect creds → POST update-credentials → capture loginUrl → open WebView). SDK widget doesn't support.
- **Verdict:** **SDK-broken** until SDK schema gains a `publisher-oauth` shape (shared mode) AND `flow=credentials-then-oauth` (per-customer mode) AND backend `/exchange-token` learns Angel One callback. In `SDK_LEGACY_FALLBACK` today, regardless of `useSharedAngelOneKey`.
- **Last verified:** 2026-04-28, commit `c85f85f`. User-reported regression: "Invalid API Key or App not found" (per-customer); shared-mode broken at `/exchange-token`.

### Upstox — SDK-with-gap

- **Legacy modal file:** `src/components/BrokerConnectionModal/upstoxModal.js`
- **Submit endpoint(s):**
  - `POST api/upstox/update-key` on aq_backend_github (line 150) — credentials + redirect_uri → mints authUrl.
  - `POST upstox/gen-access-token` on ccxt-india (line 256) — exchanges code for access_token.
  - `PUT api/user/connect-broker` on aq_backend_github (line 307) — persists jwtToken + encrypted apiKey/secretKey.
- **Encryption envelope:** `CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(value, 'ApiKeySecret')` (line 73) — apiKey + secretKey encrypted before all three calls.
- **Form fields collected:** apiKey, secretKey (both password-hidden by default).
- **OAuth WebView flow:** Yes. WebView at authUrl. Intercepts via `onNavigationStateChange` (line 224), detects `code=` (line 228).
- **Reauth handling:** Yes — `reauthConfig` pre-fills apiKey, secretKey, authUrl; skips form, jumps to WebView (lines 422–432). Hydration gated by ref.
- **IP-whitelist callout:** Yes — EgressIpCallout, `egressReady` gate at line 130, `unmetAck` flash for 2.5s if user taps Connect without acking.
- **Broker-specific quirks:**
  - Defensive URL-param parsing for Upstox error responses (lines 181–196) — avoids React Native's partial `URL().searchParams`.
  - Form-encodes spaces as `+`, not `%20` (line 187).
  - Validates `redirect_uri` before sending (lines 135–138).
- **Success handling:** Close WebView → POST gen-access-token → PUT connect-broker → optional model-portfolio refresh (line 338) → refreshEvent + toast.
- **Error handling:** Three layers: authUrl error_code/error_message detection (lines 172–210), token-exchange failure with "Connection Error" fallback (line 274), connect-broker HTTP-vs-network distinction (lines 377–395).
- **Gap vs SDK widget:**
  1. **No reauthConfig pre-fill in SDK** — losing reauth optimization (form-skip → straight to WebView with pre-signed authUrl). Cross-cutting gap; affects every credential-OAuth broker.
  2. **Defensive URL parsing** — SDK's `WebViewBrokerAuthFlow` would need to mirror Upstox's bespoke param-decoding (form-encoded spaces).
- **Verdict:** **SDK-with-gap.** Core OAuth flow is SDK-compatible; the reauth + URL-parsing nuances need either SDK widget extensions or a Phase3SdkBrokerModal-level shim. Until reauth pre-fill API exists in `BrokerCredentialForm`, do NOT promote — re-auth would force users to re-enter creds.
- **Last verified:** 2026-04-28, code-read audit; emulator end-to-end NOT yet verified.

### ICICI Direct — SDK-with-gap

- **Legacy modal file:** `src/components/BrokerConnectionModal/icicimodal.js`
- **Submit endpoint(s):**
  - `PUT api/icici/update-key` (line 284) — credentials → backend returns login URL.
  - `POST icici/customer-details` on ccxt-india (line 188) — exchanges `apisession` query param for `session_token`.
  - `PUT api/user/connect-broker` (line 222) — persists session_token + encrypted apiKey.
- **Encryption envelope:** `CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(value, 'ApiKeySecret')` (line 258 for apiKey, line 211 for secretKey on persist).
- **Form fields collected:** apiKey, secretKey.
- **OAuth WebView flow:** Yes. WebView navigates to ICICI's direct login URL (line 295). Intercepts via `onNavigationStateChange` (line 168), detects `apisession=` (NOT OAuth `code=`).
- **Reauth handling:** Yes — `reauthConfig` pre-fills apiKey + authUrl, skips credential form (lines 98–106).
- **IP-whitelist callout:** Yes — EgressIpCallout, `egressReady` gate (line 268).
- **Broker-specific quirks:**
  - **ICICI returns `apisession=` not OAuth `code=`** — non-standard query param.
  - **CCXT-relayed exchange** — backend `customer-details` endpoint handles `apisession → session_token` (no direct `/gen-access-token` step like other OAuth brokers).
- **Success handling:** Close WebView → POST customer-details → PUT connect-broker → optional model-portfolio refresh → refreshEvent + toast.
- **Error handling:** Two-level: session exchange fail "Connection Failed" alert (line 203), connect-broker HTTP-vs-network distinction (lines 237–254).
- **Gap vs SDK widget:**
  1. **`apisession` capture vs OAuth `code`** — SDK's `WebViewBrokerAuthFlow` matches generic redirect URL but the param the SDK forwards is whatever it captures; backend `/sdk/v1/connections/ICICI Direct/exchange-token` would need to accept `apisession` and proxy to ccxt `customer-details`. Verify backend behavior.
  2. **No reauthConfig pre-fill in SDK.**
  3. **EgressIpCallout content** — Phase3SdkBrokerModal has the callout for ICICI but the legacy step-by-step IP-claim screens may be richer than what `EgressIpCallout` shows today (user feedback 2026-04-28: "sdk does not show the steps and the static IP claim etc screen").
- **Verdict:** **SDK-with-gap.** Backend `exchange-token` for ICICI must be verified; reauth pre-fill missing; IP callout content thinner than legacy.
- **Last verified:** 2026-04-28, code-read audit.

---

### Kotak Securities — SDK-broken

- **Legacy modal file:** `src/components/BrokerConnectionModal/KotakModal.js`
- **Submit endpoint:** `PUT api/kotak/connect-broker` (line 209) — single comprehensive call with apiKey + mobileNumber + mpin + ucc + totp. No separate `/update-key` or OAuth step.
- **Encryption envelope:** `CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(apiKey, 'ApiKeySecret')` (line 200) — only apiKey encrypted; mobileNumber, mpin, ucc, totp sent plaintext.
- **Form fields collected:** apiKey, mobileNumber (10-digit, normalized), mpin (6-digit), ucc, totp (6-digit TOTP code).
- **OAuth WebView flow:** **No.** Pure credentials + TOTP.
- **Reauth handling:** No `reauthConfig` prop. On reconnect, pre-fills mobileNumber from `connected_brokers[broker='Kotak'].mobileNumber` (lines 80–93). User re-enters mpin + totp.
- **IP-whitelist callout:** Yes — EgressIpCallout, `egressReady` gate (line 130).
- **Broker-specific quirks:**
  - **TOTP rotates every 30s** — Kotak enforces 30s debounce on Connect button to avoid parallel requests reusing a stale TOTP (lines 116–151).
  - Mobile number normalization strips `+91`/`0` prefix (lines 164–182).
  - mpin (6-digit) and totp (6-digit) strict validation (lines 184–196).
  - TOTP-error detection: if error contains 'otp'/'totp'/'two factor', surface hint about regeneration (lines 316–320).
- **Success handling:** Direct PUT (no WebView) → optional model-portfolio refresh → refreshEvent + toast.
- **Error handling:** Granular TOTP-aware error wording.
- **Gap vs SDK widget:**
  1. **SDK schema today: `flow=credentials_totp, fields=[consumerKey, consumerSecret, mobileNumber, password, mpin]`.** This doesn't match legacy fields exactly: legacy has `apiKey + mobileNumber + mpin + ucc + totp`; SDK schema lists `consumerKey + consumerSecret + mobileNumber + password + mpin`. Verify whether SDK schema or legacy is correct for current Kotak NEO API.
  2. SDK widget doesn't support 30s TOTP-debounce gate.
  3. No `ucc` field in SDK schema.
  4. No `totp` field (SDK has `mpin` but `mpin` is a separate piece).
- **Verdict:** **SDK-broken** until the SDK schema matches the live Kotak NEO API exactly AND adds a TOTP-debounce gate. Legacy KotakModal was migrated to NEO recently (commit `b6e3601`); SDK schema may be outdated.
- **Last verified:** 2026-04-28, code-read audit. Schema mismatch flagged for Kotak NEO commit ref.

### Dhan — SDK-with-gap

- **Legacy modal file:** `src/components/BrokerConnectionModal/DhanConnectModal.js`
- **Submit endpoint(s):**
  - `GET dhan/login` on ccxt-india (line 91, prefetch) — generates consent URL, follows 302 chain client-side.
  - `PUT api/user/connect-broker` (line 193) — persists clientCode + jwtToken.
- **Encryption envelope:** None — OAuth tokens passed plaintext.
- **Form fields collected:** None in OAuth mode. Fallback manual mode: clientId + accessToken (lines 36–37).
- **OAuth WebView flow:** Yes. WebView loads prefetched OAuth URL (line 283). CCXT relay redirects through ccxt → auth.dhan.co → partner-login.dhan.co. Intercepts via `onNavigationStateChange` (line 132), detects `dhan_client_id=` + `dhan_access_token=` (line 136).
- **Reauth handling:** No `reauthConfig` prop.
- **IP-whitelist callout:** None.
- **Broker-specific quirks:**
  - **Prefetch optimization** (lines 101–127) — on modal mount, fetches OAuth URL in parallel using `fetch({redirect:'follow'})` to follow the 302 chain client-side, lands final URL in state before WebView opens.
  - **Manual fallback path** — if OAuth fails, user can paste clientId + accessToken directly.
- **Success handling:** Close WebView → PUT connect-broker → optional model-portfolio refresh → refreshEvent + toast.
- **Error handling:** Generic "Connection Failed" / "Connection Issue" wording (lines 247–264).
- **Gap vs SDK widget:**
  1. SDK widget today: `flow=credentials, fields=[accessToken], submitEndpoint=connect`. This matches the manual-fallback path, NOT the primary OAuth path.
  2. SDK widget lacks prefetch + 302-chain-follow logic.
  3. No SDK widget shape for "primary OAuth, fallback to credentials" composite flow.
- **Verdict:** **SDK-with-gap.** SDK can cover the manual-fallback path (paste accessToken) but not the primary OAuth-with-prefetch path. Either SDK schema for Dhan switches to `flow=oauth` (losing manual fallback) OR SDK gains a `flow=oauth-with-credentials-fallback` shape.
- **Last verified:** 2026-04-28, code-read audit.

### Fyers — SDK-with-gap

#### 2026-09-29 — first-connect host gate corrected

The SDK Fyers schema remains SDK-clean and includes the setup guide plus
`EgressIpCallout`. The apparent minimal TOTP/PIN form was not an SDK schema or
fallback: `DeviceTotpReconnectGate` was rendering before dispatch for an
unenrolled customer without carrying that guide. Fyers remains eligible for
deferred first-connect enrolment, but the host gate now renders the same
developer-portal instructions, redirect URL and `fyers` `EgressIpCallout`
before offering the optional phone-TOTP fields. It then reaches the full
SDK/legacy App ID/Secret + OAuth onboarding, and saves device values only after
successful authorization. Connected customers retain the compact quick-
reconnect path.

- **Legacy modal file:** `src/components/BrokerConnectionModal/FyersConnect.js`
- **Submit endpoint(s):**
  - `POST api/fyers/update-key` (line 300) — mints auth URL from `clientCode + secretKey`.
  - `POST fyers/gen-access-token` on ccxt-india (line 130) — exchanges `auth_code` for accessToken.
  - `PUT api/user/connect-broker` (line 176) — persists jwtToken + clientCode + encrypted secretKey.
- **Encryption envelope:** `CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(apiKey, 'ApiKeySecret')` (line 279) — only apiKey encrypted on persist.
- **Form fields collected:** apiKey (OAuth secret in DB → modal naming `apiKey`), secretKey (clientId in DB → modal naming `secretKey`).
- **OAuth WebView flow:** Yes. Intercepts via `onNavigationStateChange` (line 100), detects `auth_code=` (line 104).
- **Reauth handling:** Yes — `reauthConfig` consumed, with field-name translation (modal `apiKey` ↔ DB `secretKey`, modal `secretKey` ↔ DB `clientCode`) at lines 346–355.
- **IP-whitelist callout:** Yes — EgressIpCallout, `egressReady` gate (line 287).
- **Broker-specific quirks:**
  - **Field-naming inversion** — modal `apiKey` is OAuth secret; modal `secretKey` is clientId. Opposite of DB. Reauth translation handles this.
  - update-key endpoint returns `response.data.response` (not `.authUrl`).
- **Success handling:** Close WebView → POST gen-access-token → PUT connect-broker → toast + refreshEvent.
- **Error handling:** "Connection Error" / "Connection Issue" wording (lines 248–263).
- **Gap vs SDK widget:**
  1. **Field-naming inversion** — SDK `BrokerCredentialForm` for Fyers needs schema mapping `apiKey↔secretKey, secretKey↔clientCode` to match user expectations on screen. If schema is `[apiKey, apiSecret]` (standard OAuth), the user-visible field names won't match Fyers's developer portal naming.
  2. No reauthConfig pre-fill in SDK.
- **Verdict:** **SDK-with-gap.** Schema rename + reauth pre-fill required.
- **Last verified:** 2026-04-28, code-read audit.

#### 2026-05-01 — Fyers backend exchange-token + smart-reauth + update-key fully aligned to new schema (4-round saga)

After the morning's SDK schema rewrite (App ID / App Secret / Fyers User ID labels), THREE backend paths still had old-schema field semantics:

1. **`/api/fyers/update-key`** (login-url path) — `Routes/Broker/Fyers.js`. Was forwarding `data.apiKey` to ccxt as `clientId` WITHOUT decrypting. Fix: `tryDecrypt`-or-passthrough heuristic (`U2FsdGVkX1` prefix → AES-decrypt, else plaintext) on both `data.apiKey` and `data.clientCode`. Resolution: prefer decrypted `data.apiKey` as App ID; fall back to decrypted `data.clientCode` (legacy).
2. **`/api/user/brokers/Fyers/reauth-url`** (smart-reauth path) — `Routes/multiBrokerRoutes.js:818-843`. Was reading `credentials.clientCode` raw and forwarding to ccxt. Fix: same `tryDec` helper; resolution prefers `credentials.apiKey` then `credentials.clientCode`. **This was the actual code path the SDK auto-jump uses** — fixing only `/update-key` (rounds 1-2) was a no-op for the user's flow.
3. **`/sdk/v1/connections/Fyers/exchange-token`** — `Routes/sdk/v1/connections.js:1643-1713`. Was computing `SHA-256("YR17597:UMEG2NCP7W-200")` (FY user ID treated as App ID, App ID treated as App Secret). Fix: branch on `body.apiKey` presence:
   - **Form path** (`body.apiKey` present): `fyClientId = decrypt(body.apiKey)` (App ID), `fyClientSecret = decrypt(body.secretKey)` (App Secret).
   - **Autojump path** (`body.apiKey` absent): `fyClientId = body.clientCode` (App ID, legacy), `fyClientSecret = decrypt(body.secretKey)` (encrypted App Secret).
   - Persistence writes plaintext App ID under BOTH `connected_brokers[Fyers].apiKey` AND `.clientCode` for autojump robustness; encrypted App Secret under `.secretKey`.

**Production impact and recovery:**

User `prikc1333@gmail.com` (tidi tenant) retried 4× and saw "invalid clientId" / "invalid app id hash" each time, because each retry happened to hit a different un-fixed path. After the round-4 fix, end-to-end flow verified on emulator:
- form → /sdk/v1/connections/Fyers/login-url → /api/fyers/update-key → ccxt → Fyers OAuth login → callback with `auth_code` → /sdk/v1/connections/Fyers/exchange-token → ccxt /fyers/gen-access-token (correct SHA-256 hash) → access token persisted.

DB corruption recovery: the round-1 half-fix had written the encrypted `apiKey` blob into the `clientCode` field. Cleaned up via direct mongo `$pull`/`$unset` on the affected user. The `tryDecrypt`-or-passthrough heuristic also auto-recovers any future user in the same corrupted state without manual intervention.

**Verdict:** Fyers stays **SDK-clean** — all three backend paths now correctly resolve App ID and App Secret regardless of whether the user came via form, autojump, or smart-reauth.

**Lessons recorded** in `Alphab2bapp/CLAUDE.md` top-level "🔴 Lesson — broker auth bugs" section: enumerate every ccxt-auth callsite BEFORE writing any fix; encryption symmetry rule; App ID vs user ID labelling; data-corruption recovery via route resilience + DB cleanup.

#### 2026-05-01 — Fyers field labels disambiguated (App ID vs Fyers user ID)

Production users (e.g. clientId `YR17597`) were typing their **Fyers login user ID** into the field labelled `clientCode` and a placeholder `Your Fyers ID (e.g. XL12345)`, then expecting OAuth to succeed. The legacy backend treats `clientCode` as the OAuth `client_id` (App ID from myapi.fyers.in, e.g. `UMEG2NCP7W-200`). The SDK widget inherited this confusion via `broker_form_schema.dart`'s Fyers entry — the field labelled "Client Code" with helper "Your Fyers ID" was actually expected to hold the App ID.

Fix shipped in `alphaquark-mobile-sdk/packages/flutter/lib/src/widgets/broker_form_schema.dart` (Fyers entry):

- **`apiKey` field** relabelled `App ID`, placeholder `e.g. UMEG2NCP7W-200`, helper explicitly stating "From myapi.fyers.in → My Apps → App ID. NOT your Fyers user ID."
- **`secretKey` field** relabelled `App Secret` with helper pointing at myapi.fyers.in.
- **`clientCode` field** relabelled `Fyers User ID` with placeholder `e.g. XL12345 or YR12345` and helper "Your Fyers login ID (used for display only)" — explicitly noting that this is NOT used in OAuth.
- Schema `intro` now reads "Create an app at myapi.fyers.in to get your App ID and App Secret. Do NOT confuse the App ID with your Fyers user ID (YR…/XL…)."
- Prerequisites list expanded to enumerate App ID, App Secret, and Fyers user ID separately.

Backend already accepts the corrected mapping: `aq_backend_github/Routes/Broker/Fyers.js` reads `appId = data.apiKey || data.clientCode`, so the App ID submitted via the SDK form's `apiKey` field flows through as the OAuth client_id correctly.

### IIFL Securities — SDK-broken

- **Legacy modal file:** `src/components/iiflmodal.js` (note: in `src/components/`, not `src/components/BrokerConnectionModal/`)
- **Submit endpoint(s):**
  - `POST /api/iifl/update-key` — stores AES-wrapped customer App Key/App Secret and returns the customer-specific IIFL login URL.
  - `POST /api/iifl/exchange` — Node retrieves the stored App Secret and exchanges callback `authcode + clientid` without returning the secret to app JavaScript.
  - `PUT /api/user/connect-broker` — persists `clientCode + jwtToken` in the standard MongoDB `connected_brokers[]` record.
  - `POST /api/iifl/reauth-url` — uses the saved App Key for later daily browser login.
- **Encryption envelope:** `CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(value, 'ApiKeySecret')` for App Key and App Secret before the update-key request.
- **Form fields collected:** App Key and App Secret from the customer's IIFL Individual Trader API app.
- **OAuth WebView flow:** Yes. It accepts only the configured redirect URL and parses `authcode/clientid`, camel-case aliases, and retired `auth_token` compatibility callbacks.
- **Reauth handling:** Yes. Explicit `reauthConfig.authUrl` is accepted; otherwise saved direct credentials trigger `/api/iifl/reauth-url` automatically.
- **IP-whitelist callout:** Yes. `BrokerConnectStepperSheet` renders the `iifl` `EgressIpCallout`; the user must acknowledge that the exact displayed Route64 IPv6 is whitelisted.
- **Broker-specific quirks:**
  - Browser login is required each trading day even though the developer app credentials are saved.
  - AsyncStorage is retained as compatibility storage only; MongoDB is authoritative.
  - The app and web instructions both require registering the displayed redirect URL and displayed IPv6 in the IIFL developer portal.
- **Success handling:** MongoDB persistence → AsyncStorage compatibility write → status refresh → success toast with the daily-login reminder.
- **Error handling:** Node/upstream response details are shown in the sheet/toast; duplicate callback exchange is guarded by a ref.
- **Gap vs SDK widget:**
  1. SDK schema fields and authentication mode do not match the live Individual Trader API contract.
  2. SDK lane does not yet reproduce the Node secret-preserving exchange plus IIFL IPv6 guide/gate.
- **Verdict:** **SDK-broken / legacy-correct.** Keep `IIFL` in `SDK_LEGACY_FALLBACK` until the SDK implements the same direct OAuth contract. The production fallback itself is enabled and complete.
- **Last verified:** 2026-09-27 — focused parser/support/order-book tests and release build pending in this change.

### AliceBlue — SDK-with-gap

- **Legacy modal file:** `src/components/BrokerConnectionModal/AliceBlueConnect.js`
- **Submit endpoint(s):**
  - `GET aliceblue/login?origin=...&returnPath=...` on ccxt-india (line 42) — routes through CCXT for OAuth, returns final URL.
  - `PUT api/user/connect-broker` (line 178) — persists access_token + client_id.
- **Encryption envelope:** None — OAuth tokens passed plaintext.
- **Form fields collected:** **None.** Pure OAuth/WebView.
- **OAuth WebView flow:** Yes. Intercepts via `onNavigationStateChange` (line 120), detects `user_broker=AliceBlue` + `access_token=` + `client_id=` (lines 128–129).
- **Reauth handling:** No `reauthConfig` prop.
- **IP-whitelist callout:** No.
- **Broker-specific quirks:**
  - **HARDCODED `prod.alphaquark.in` origin** (line 40) — DO NOT read from `REACT_APP_BROKER_CONNECT_REDIRECT_URL`. AliceBlue's partner appcode is allow-listed against `prod.alphaquark.in` only. Production incident 2026-04-26: when origin was `app-links.alphaquark.in/broker-callback`, AliceBlue's portal silently bounced users after OTP because redirect URL failed appcode-whitelist check (long comment at lines 24–38).
  - SDK dual-write uses `sdkExchangeBrokerToken` (not `sdkConnectBroker`) because AliceBlue's callback yields `access_token + client_id` not `jwtToken + clientCode`.
  - **iOS blank WebView — firebase-messaging bootstrap abort (discovered 2026-06-11, root-caused same day after a first UA-only fix proved insufficient):** AliceBlue's portal Vue bundle runs firebase-messaging at module top level before `mount("#app")` — `navigator.serviceWorker.addEventListener(…)` unguarded + UA-gated `Notification.requestPermission()`. iOS WKWebView has **neither API**, so their own bootstrap throws, never mounts, and the page is blank; Android WebView has both → works. Fix: AliceBlue-gated document-start script stubs both APIs (+ Safari-style iPhone UA as the supporting fix for the UA-gated branch) — applied to the SDK `WebViewBrokerAuthFlow` (RN + Flutter) AND the legacy `AliceBlueConnectUI.js` (same latent bug, every code path fixed in one cycle). See PHASE3_ARCHITECTURE.md § WebViewBrokerAuthFlow → "AliceBlue-only WebView overrides".
- **Success handling:** Close WebView → PUT connect-broker → optional model-portfolio refresh → refreshEvent + toast.
- **Error handling:** "Connection Error" / "Connection Issue" wording (lines 260–275).
- **Gap vs SDK widget:**
  1. **SDK schema today: WRONG.** Likely set to `flow=credentials, fields=[apiKey, userId]` (per the user-reported regression "asked api etc which is not needed"). Legacy is empty-fields OAuth like Zerodha.
  2. **SDK schema needs change to `flow=oauth, fields=[]`** matching Zerodha's shape.
  3. **Hardcoded origin** — SDK's `WebViewBrokerAuthFlow` reads `redirectUrl` prop, which Phase3SdkBrokerModal sets from `Config.REACT_APP_BROKER_CONNECT_REDIRECT_URL`. For AliceBlue specifically this MUST be overridden to `prod.alphaquark.in/stock-recommendation` regardless of the env value; otherwise tenants on non-prod redirect URLs get silent OAuth bounce.
  4. EgressIpCallout — Phase3SdkBrokerModal includes it for AliceBlue (in `IP_WHITELIST_BROKERS`) but legacy AliceBlueConnect doesn't gate on IP. The Phase 3 wrapper's IP gate may be UNNECESSARY for AliceBlue. Verify before removing.
  5. Backend `/sdk/v1/connections/AliceBlue/login-url` must call ccxt `aliceblue/login` with the hardcoded `origin=https://prod.alphaquark.in&returnPath=stock-recommendation` query, not the tenant's redirect URL.
- **Verdict:** **SDK-with-gap.** Two SDK-side fixes (schema → empty-fields OAuth; redirectUrl override hardcoded) + one backend fix (login-url proxy with hardcoded origin) + one Phase3SdkBrokerModal change (remove from `IP_WHITELIST_BROKERS` if legacy doesn't gate).
- **Last verified:** 2026-06-11 — **iOS device-verified working** after the WKWebView shim fix (SDK `c0d53d5`): dev rebuilt iOS with the new SDK and AliceBlue connect worked end-to-end. Android verified working by user same day. Prior: 2026-04-28 code-read audit (user-reported regression: "should have opened the partner based oauth, that also it did not do properly, asked api etc which is not needed").

### Motilal Oswal — SDK-with-gap

- **Legacy modal file:** `src/components/BrokerConnectionModal/MotilalModal.js`
- **Submit endpoint(s):**
  - `PUT api/motilal-oswal/update-key` (line 154) — mints auth URL from apiKey + clientCode.
  - WebView intercepts `accessToken=` (line 183) — NO separate `/gen-access-token` step.
  - `PUT api/user/connect-broker` (line 211) — persists jwtToken + apiKey + clientCode.
- **Encryption envelope:** `CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(apiKey, 'ApiKeySecret')` (line 145 update-key, line 204 persist).
- **Form fields collected:** apiKey, clientCode.
- **OAuth WebView flow:** Yes. Intercepts via `onNavigationStateChange` (line 179), detects `accessToken=` (line 183).
- **Reauth handling:** Yes — `reauthConfig` pre-fills apiKey + authUrl (lines 317–325).
- **IP-whitelist callout:** Yes — EgressIpCallout, gate (line 120).
- **Broker-specific quirks:**
  - **Session-affinity guard** — Motilal binds OTP + Authorization header + page session to a single page-load. Back-to-back logins surface "Authorization Invalid" or "Two Factor Authentication Failed". 30s debounce on initiateAuth (lines 116–136).
  - **`handleRequestRestart` callback** (lines 339–344) — wipes authUrl + token + toast flag on WebView error to force full re-auth on next Connect tap.
  - SDK schema lists `[apiKey, apiSecret, userId, password, totpSecret]` — but legacy collects only `apiKey + clientCode`. Verify which is current.
- **Success handling:** Close WebView → PUT connect-broker → optional model-portfolio refresh → refreshEvent + toast.
- **Error handling:** "Connection Error" / "Connection Issue" wording (lines 276–292).
- **Gap vs SDK widget:**
  1. **Schema mismatch** — SDK schema vs legacy field set don't match. Need to verify what Motilal's API expects today and align both.
  2. SDK widget doesn't support 30s session-affinity debounce.
  3. SDK widget doesn't support `handleRequestRestart`-style WebView error → wipe state callback.
  4. No reauthConfig pre-fill in SDK.
  5. **`accessToken` capture vs OAuth `code`** — Motilal's redirect carries `accessToken` directly, no `/gen-access-token` step. Backend `/sdk/v1/connections/Motilal Oswal/exchange-token` must accept `accessToken` and skip the gen-access-token call.
- **Verdict:** **SDK-with-gap.** Schema alignment + session-affinity + reauth + backend exchange-token shape — multiple gaps.
- **Last verified:** 2026-04-28, code-read audit.

### HDFC Securities — SDK-clean (PROMOTED 2026-04-28)

- **Legacy modal file:** `src/components/BrokerConnectionModal/HDFCconnectModal.js`
- **Submit endpoint(s):**
  - `POST api/hdfc/update-key` (line 315) — mints auth URL from apiKey + secretKey.
  - `POST hdfc/access-token` on ccxt-india (line 139) — exchanges `requestToken` for accessToken.
  - `PUT api/user/connect-broker` (line 186) — persists jwtToken + apiKey + secretKey.
- **Encryption envelope:** `CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(value, 'ApiKeySecret')` for both apiKey and secretKey (lines 309–310 update-key, line 181 persist).
- **Form fields collected:** apiKey, secretKey.
- **OAuth WebView flow:** Yes. Intercepts via `onNavigationStateChange` (line 109), detects `requestToken=` (line 113).
- **Reauth handling:** Yes — `reauthConfig` pre-fills apiKey + secretKey + authUrl (lines 290–300).
- **IP-whitelist callout:** Yes — EgressIpCallout, gate (line 303).
- **Broker-specific quirks:** Returns `requestToken` (not OAuth `code`); CCXT exchanges via `hdfc/access-token`. Standard pattern, similar to Upstox.
- **Success handling:** Close WebView → POST access-token → PUT connect-broker → toast + refreshEvent.
- **Error handling:** "Connection Error" / "Connection Issue" wording (lines 250–267).
- **Gap vs SDK widget:**
  1. `requestToken` vs `code` — backend `/sdk/v1/connections/Hdfc Securities/exchange-token` must accept `requestToken` query param and proxy to ccxt `hdfc/access-token`. Verify backend behavior.
  2. **Reauth pre-fill missing in SDK** — cross-cutting gap. HDFC reauth would lose the form-skip.
  3. EgressIpCallout for HDFC — Phase3SdkBrokerModal does NOT include HDFC in `IP_WHITELIST_BROKERS` today. Legacy DOES gate on egressReady. If HDFC needs IP whitelist, Phase3SdkBrokerModal `IP_WHITELIST_BROKERS` set must be extended.
- **Verdict:** **SDK-clean (PROMOTED 2026-04-28)**. All three blockers addressed:
  - (a) Backend `/exchange-token` HDFC dispatch added in `aq_backend_github/Routes/sdk/v1/connections.js` (after `Axis Securities` else-if, before `ICICI Direct`). Calls ccxt `/hdfc/access-token` with `{apiKey, apiSecret, requestToken}`, extracts `accessToken`, returns `{jwtToken, apiKey, secretKey}` for the persist step. Backend deploy required (scp to tidi + `sudo systemctl restart alphaquark.service`).
  - (b) `IP_WHITELIST_BROKERS` set in `Phase3SdkBrokerModal.js` extended to include `'HDFC'` and `'Hdfc Securities'`.
  - (c) `BrokerConnectModalDispatch.SDK_ELIGIBLE_MODALS` set updated from `new Set([])` to `new Set(['HDFC'])`. First Phase 3 broker promotion.
  - (d) `Phase3BrokerHelp` already renders `HDFCHelpContent` (existing) — video ID `XFLjL8hOctI` + 5 step guide visible above the form, matching legacy.
- **Last verified:** 2026-04-28 — code-read audit + UX parity assessment. End-to-end emulator verification PENDING (user testing). Commit will be reverted if user reports parity break during testing.

---

### Groww — SDK-clean (PROMOTED 2026-04-29)

- **Legacy modal file:** `src/components/BrokerConnectionModal/GrowwConnectModal.js`
- **Submit endpoint:** `POST api/groww/update-key` (line 139) — single comprehensive call with apiKey + totp_seed (both encrypted). No OAuth, no separate connect-broker step.
- **Encryption envelope:** `CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(plain, 'ApiKeySecret')` for both apiKey and totp_seed (line 44).
- **Form fields collected:**
  - **apiKey** — long JWT-style "TOTP Token" from Groww dialog top.
  - **totpToken** — ~32-char Base32 secret string from below QR code, NOT the JWT.
- **OAuth WebView flow:** **No.** Pure credentials + Base32 TOTP.
- **Reauth handling:** No `reauthConfig` prop. Reauth still routes to legacy via the cross-cutting `isReauthFlow` short-circuit in `BrokerConnectModalDispatch.js`. Note: legacy backend has `/api/groww/refresh-token` for silent reauth — SDK reauth route doesn't yet expose this, but the in-app reauth path is unchanged because reauth always goes legacy.
- **IP-whitelist callout:** Yes — EgressIpCallout, gate (line 110). `IP_WHITELIST_BROKERS` set in `Phase3SdkBrokerModal` already includes `'Groww'`.
- **Broker-specific quirks:**
  - **Dual TOTP values from Groww UI** — JWT ("TOTP Token") + Base32 secret (below QR). User documentation is extensive (lines 292–383) because confusion is common. Both legacy and SDK present 2 fields with helper text spelling out which value goes where.
  - Granular error codes from ccxt-india `app_groww.py`: `NOT_BASE32`, `WRONG_LENGTH`, `GROWW_REJECTED` (line 212).
  - Inline help panel toggles between collapsed (form primary) and expanded ("Important Notes" + "Need Help"), matching Zerodha's pattern.
- **Success handling:** Direct POST update-key (no WebView, no connect-broker) → optional model-portfolio refresh → refreshEvent + toast.
- **Error handling:** Granular per-error-code copy (lines 216–268). SDK widget surfaces these as generic `SdkRequestError` with the upstream `detail` — accepted minor diff (matches Kotak/Motilal precedent).
- **Gap analysis (closed):**
  1. ~~SDK schema [accessToken] vs legacy [apiKey, totp_seed]~~ — **closed by mobile-SDK commit `0291e02`**: schema now `flow=credentials, fields=[apiKey, growwTotpSeed], submitEndpoint=connect`. Field name mismatch (SDK `growwTotpSeed` vs legacy `totp_seed`) absorbed by backend dispatch (`Routes/sdk/v1/connections.js:602-614` accepts either: `body.totp_seed || body.growwTotpSeed`).
  2. ~~16-char strict pattern rejected real Groww secrets~~ — **closed**: pattern relaxed to `^[A-Z2-7]+$/i` (any-length Base32). Wrong-length validation moved server-side in `app_groww.py:_normalize_totp_token` (`NOT_BASE32`, `WRONG_LENGTH` error codes).
  3. ~~`/sdk/v1/connections/Groww/connect` persist-only with no ccxt validation~~ — **closed by backend**: `CREDENTIAL_BROKER_VALIDATE_DISPATCH.Groww` proxies through `/api/groww/update-key` → ccxt validates via Groww `/v1/login` before persistence. Same UX guarantee as legacy (typo'd creds rejected at connect, not at trade-execution time).
- **Accepted minor diffs (not blockers):**
  - Per-error-code custom rendering for `NOT_BASE32` / `WRONG_LENGTH` / `GROWW_REJECTED` / `INVALID_SEED` / `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` — legacy renders 5 broker-specific actionable messages, SDK shows generic `SdkRequestError` with upstream detail. Tracked as Known SDK Gap.
  - Inline help-panel toggle visual chrome — legacy uses "Read More / See Less" with chevron; SDK uses `Phase3BrokerHelp` with `▾ Hide help` toggle (default expanded). Same content, different chrome.
- **Verdict:** **SDK-clean (PROMOTED 2026-04-29)**. Added to `SDK_ELIGIBLE_MODALS` in `BrokerConnectModalDispatch.js`. End-to-end emulator verification PENDING.
- **Last verified:** 2026-04-29, code-read audit + gap closure verified. Note: prior session added Groww App Links via AndroidManifest (commit `f9f5d0f`) but `GrowwConnectModal` does NOT use deep links; pure credential-paste. App Links serve a different broker flow path.

---

### Axis Securities — SDK-with-gap (backend-side)

- **Legacy modal file:** `src/components/BrokerConnectionModal/AxisConnectModal.js`
- **Submit endpoint(s):**
  - `POST axis/login-url` on ccxt-india (line 91) — mints Axis SSO login URL.
  - `POST axis/callback` on ccxt-india (line 177) — exchanges ssoId for authToken + refreshToken.
  - `PUT api/user/connect-broker` (line 305) — persists clientCode + authToken + refreshToken.
- **Encryption envelope:** None — SSO tokens passed plaintext.
- **Form fields collected:** **None.** Pure SSO/WebView (broker-hosted login).
- **OAuth WebView flow:** Yes. **Dual-method intercept:** `onShouldStartLoadWithRequest` (line 147, fires BEFORE WebView loads, returns false to prevent blank landing) + `onNavigationStateChange` (line 158, fallback after URL change). Both extract `ssoId` (lines 124–141) and trigger callback.
- **Reauth handling:** No `reauthConfig` prop. Re-auth uses `existingAxisCode` fallback (line 267) — Axis sometimes omits `accounts[]` array on re-auth because subAccountId is invariant; modal looks up prior `connected_brokers[broker='Axis Securities'].clientCode`.
- **IP-whitelist callout:** None (Axis SSO is broker-hosted).
- **Broker-specific quirks:**
  - Defensive URL parsing avoids React Native's partial `URL().searchParams` (lines 124–141).
  - Axis response envelope can vary: `{data: {...}}` or flat (line 187); authToken nested under multiple paths (`data.authToken`, `data.tokens.authToken`, `data.metadata.authToken`, etc., lines 213–227).
  - `existingAxisCode` fallback for re-auth subAccountId omission (line 267).
  - Uses `CrossPlatformOverlay` instead of raw `<Modal>` (line 391) to avoid Android stacking bugs when opening Axis while ManageConnectionsModal is unmounting.
- **Success handling:** Close WebView → POST callback → PUT connect-broker → toast + refreshEvent.
- **Error handling:** Upstream error detection — Axis can return 200 with `error: {code, error}` envelope (lines 200–206). Network errors get "Connection Issue" (line 364).
- **Gap vs SDK widget:**
  1. **Backend `/sdk/v1/connections/Axis Securities/login-url` proxy is missing or broken** — returns `sdk_error: broker_login_url_failed` per user-reported 2026-04-28 regression. Legacy itself works fine (calls ccxt `axis/login-url` directly); the SDK route doesn't proxy that call. **Fix in `aq_backend_github/Routes/sdk/v1/connections.js`** to add Axis dispatch.
  2. **Robust envelope handling** — backend `/exchange-token` for Axis must handle the multiple authToken nesting paths.
  3. **`existingAxisCode` fallback** — needs server-side awareness for SDK reauth to work.
  4. **CrossPlatformOverlay** — not a widget concern; lives in Phase3SdkBrokerModal which already uses Pressable scrim.
- **Verdict:** **SDK-with-gap.** Legacy is solid; SDK is blocked on backend route. Once the backend `login-url` proxy is implemented and verified, Axis is closest to SDK-clean (after HDFC) given there's no IP gate, no reauth pre-fill issue (no reauthConfig anyway), and the SDK widget's redirect-intercept is generic enough to catch `ssoId=`.
- **Last verified:** 2026-04-28, code-read audit. User-reported SDK regression: `broker_login_url_failed`.

## Cross-cutting gaps

These affect multiple brokers and are listed once for visibility:

1. **Re-auth pre-fill missing in SDK** — `BrokerCredentialForm` cannot accept pre-filled stored creds. Affects every credential broker (Upstox, ICICI, HDFC, Motilal, Fyers). Mitigated today by routing all reauth flows to legacy via `isReauthFlow` short-circuit.
2. **`WebViewBrokerAuthFlow.onClose` cred preservation** — When user backs out of WebView, form re-mounts and loses collected creds. Affects every OAuth broker with non-empty fields.
3. **`EgressIpCallout` content vs legacy IP-claim screens** — Legacy modals (Kotak, Groww, AliceBlue, ICICI) have richer step-by-step IP-claim instructions. Phase3SdkBrokerModal's callout may be sparser. **Action:** diff legacy IP UI vs `EgressIpCallout` content for each.
4. **Backend `/exchange-token` per-broker callback handlers** — Brokers with non-standard query params (`apisession` for ICICI, `requestToken` for HDFC, `accessToken` for Motilal, `auth_token` for Angel One/AliceBlue, `ssoId` for Axis) need broker-specific server-side dispatch. Audit `aq_backend_github/Routes/sdk/v1/connections.js` exchange-token implementation against this list.
5. **SDK schema mismatches with live broker APIs** — Kotak NEO and Motilal Oswal show evidence of schema drift between `brokerFormSchema.ts` and the live broker API. Schema audit needed.
6. **30-second debounces / session-affinity** — Kotak (TOTP rotation) and Motilal (page-session affinity) both enforce 30s gaps between submit attempts. SDK widget has no equivalent.
7. **SDK widget schema for "no-form" OAuth brokers** — AliceBlue and (in shared mode) Angel One are pure broker-initiated OAuth with embedded apiKey. SDK shape that fits is `flow=oauth, fields=[]` (Zerodha's shape). For each, verify the SDK schema row and fix.
8. **`IP_WHITELIST_BROKERS` set in Phase3SdkBrokerModal** — currently `{Kotak, Groww, AliceBlue, ICICI, ICICI Direct}`. Audit findings:
   - **HDFC** legacy gates on egressReady but is NOT in the set. Add.
   - **Upstox** legacy gates on egressReady but is NOT in the set. Add.
   - **Fyers** legacy gates on egressReady but is NOT in the set. Add.
   - **Motilal Oswal** legacy gates on egressReady but is NOT in the set. Add.
   - **AliceBlue** is in the set but legacy does NOT gate. Verify whether to remove.
   - **Kotak / Groww** legacy DOES gate. Stay.

## How to update this doc

When you change anything in the Phase 3 surface area:

1. Find the broker row(s) the change affects.
2. Update the relevant fields (legacy submit endpoint, gap analysis, verdict, last verified).
3. If the change closes a gap → promote verdict (e.g. SDK-with-gap → SDK-clean) AND add the broker to `SDK_ELIGIBLE_MODALS` in `ModalManager.js` AND log in `PHASE3_PROGRESS.md`.
4. If the change opens a gap → demote verdict AND remove from `SDK_ELIGIBLE_MODALS` (or add to `SDK_LEGACY_FALLBACK` as a quick mitigation) AND log in `PHASE3_PROGRESS.md`.

Never let `SDK_ELIGIBLE_MODALS` and this doc disagree.

## 2026-07-18 — Mobile guide/render correction (code-read + debug build)

| Surface | Finding | Current state |
|---|---|---|
| Upstox and every configured guide | A paused inline YouTube iframe exposed YouTube's own external hand-off. | Explicit walkthrough control now mounts `BrokerWalkthroughPlayer` and starts playback in-app. Broker portal links are still intentionally external. |
| ICICI Direct | SDK supplied `ICICI Direct`, while the guide map only had `ICICI`; it therefore displayed the older help component. | Display-name normalisation selects the shared guide card and current Egress flow. |
| HDFC Securities | SDK supplied `Hdfc Securities`, while the guide map only had `HDFC`; same fall-through. | Display-name normalisation selects the shared guide card and current Egress flow. |
| IIFL Securities | Instructions/UI did not match the live broker authorisation path and the connection could hang. | Re-certified 2026-09-27: customer-owned App Key/App Secret, exact redirect URL + Route64 IPv6 instructions, Node exchange, MongoDB persistence, and deliberate SDK fallback. |

This is not a broker API certification: the Android debug build and source paths
were checked, but each broker still needs its normal real-account connection
test before its production verdict can be promoted.

### Angel One policy correction — 2026-07-18

Shared/platform SmartAPI login is disabled for AlphaB2B. New Angel One connects
must use the SDK per-customer credential form and the customer static-IP gate;
the legacy shared publisher-login sheet is not a dispatch target. Existing
connected customers are not silently migrated—the next reconnect requires their
own SmartAPI credentials and normal broker verification.
